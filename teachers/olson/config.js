    high: "High fidelity. You recognized the function of Student's behavior, kept access to the routine available, prompted the replacement behavior, and reinforced the first plan-aligned response quickly enough to strengthen future implementation.",
    mid: "Developing fidelity. Your response included supportive elements, but one active ingredient was missing or delayed. Tighten the next move by making the first step observable, prompting the replacement behavior earlier, or reinforcing re-entry faster.",
    low: "Low fidelity. The response drifted from the BIP and may have increased escape, adult attention, peer attention, or escalation. Reset by reducing language, returning to the function-based plan, and reinforcing the first safe step back into the routine.",
